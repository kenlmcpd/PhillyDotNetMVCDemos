
Open Startup
	Go to the Configure Method 
		Add this code to the method before the defualt settings

			var supportedCultures = new List<CultureInfo>
				{
					new CultureInfo("fr"),
					new CultureInfo("es-ES"),
				};
            
				var requestLocalizationOptions = new RequestLocalizationOptions
				{
					SupportedCultures = supportedCultures,
					SupportedUICultures = supportedCultures
				};

				app.UseRequestLocalization(requestLocalizationOptions, defaultRequestCulture: new RequestCulture("en-US"));

	Go to the ConfigureServices Method
		Replace services.AddMvc() with this code:

			services.AddLocalization(options => options.ResourcesPath = "Resources");

			services
                .AddMvc()
                .AddViewLocalization(options => options.ResourcesPath = "Resources")              
                .AddDataAnnotationsLocalization();

Open the Resources Folder
	Open each of the resource files
		Notice each converts English to either French or Spanish


Open the View Folder and then the Home Folder
	Look at the layout pages each view uses

Now open the Shared views
	Notice the tags

		
Compile and run


Run in Browser for US

Run with Postman for France and Spain

http://localhost:39322/

Add Header variables

	Accept-Language		es-ES

	Accept-Language		fr

	
	The user is sent to the correct globalization based on their browser language 

	The resource files dictate the language

	The localization page (http://localhost:39322/home/Locpage) is supposed to change the language 
	dynamically - however I could not get it working properly
