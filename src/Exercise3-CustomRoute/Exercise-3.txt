
Open Startup
	Under the Configure Method, look for app.UseMvc(routes =>
	Add this route: 
			routes.DefaultHandler = new LocalizedRoute(routes.DefaultHandler);
	(Make sure it is before the default route)

Open the LocalizedRoute Class
	Within the users dictionary add the following (or make up your own names)
			{ "Javier", "es-ES" },
            { "Rob", "en-CA" },
            { "Ken", "en-US" },

Review the Rest of the RouteHandler Code

Open LocaleAttribute
	Add The following Attribute 
		public LocaleAttribute(string locale)
            : base("locale", routeValue: locale, blockNonAttributedActions: true)
        {
        }

Open the controllers
	Add the correct Attribute to the product controller
		Canada: Add [Locale("en-CA")] above the class name
		Spain:  Add [Locale("es-ES")] above the class name
		US:     Add  [Locale("en-US")] above the class name

Open the HomeController
	Notice we are just returning a string 

Compile and run the application

Run with Postman

http://localhost:38215/
With the header User and Javier
With the header User and Rob
With the header User and Ken

http://localhost:38215/products
With the header User and Javier
With the header User and Rob
With the header User and Ken


The way it works, in startup the route structure points to LocalizedRoute 
The local is extract by the user's name
